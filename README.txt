python evrionment
python package: numpy, sklearn

put the raw data into ./raw
clean.py will clean the data
extfea1 / 2 will extract feature from the cleaned data
sample.py is for split the data into two parts for local test
all stdmodel_*.py are the modelling scripts, since I included the uamp file here, thus you can run them even without raw data
